Import paths
============

.. danger::
    With dynamic segmentation, importing paths is very risky if paths are already present in the same area in Geotrek,
    it is only safe for an area where no path is already created.

    Indeed, if you import paths where there are existing paths, treks, POIs or trails linked topology might be impacted.

Before import paths layer, it is important to prepare them. Paths must be:

- valid geometry
- simple geometry (no intersection)
- all intersections must cut the paths
- not double or covering others

We use QGis to clean a path layer, with plugin Grass.
Here are the operations:

- check the SRID (must be the same as in Geotrek)

- vectors → geometric tools → "collect geometries"

- vectors → geometric tools → "group"

- clean geometries
    - search "v_clean" in "Processing toolbox"
    - select following options in cleaning tool: break, snap, duplicate (ou rmdup), rmline, rmdangle, chdangle, bpol, prune
    - in threshold enter 2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2 (2 meters for each option)

- delete duplicate geometries
    - search "duplicate" in "Processing toolbox"

- regroup lines
    - search "v.build.polyline" in "Processing toolbox")
    - select "first" in "Category number mode"

There are two ways to import path : importing your shapefile with command line,
or `via QGis following this blog post <https://makina-corpus.com/sig-webmapping/importer-une-couche-de-troncons-dans-geotrek>`_.

To import a shapefile containing your paths, use the command ``loadpaths``::

    sudo geotrek loadpaths {Troncons.shp} \
        --srid=2154 --comments-attribute IT_VTT IT_EQ IT_PEDEST \
        --encoding latin9 -i


Import data from touristic data systems (SIT)
=============================================

Configure APIDAE (ex-SITRA) import
----------------------------------

To import touristic content from APIDAE (ex-SITRA), edit ``/opt/geotrek-admin/var/conf/parsers.py`` file with the following content:

::

    from geotrek.tourism.parsers import TouristicContentApidaeParser

    class HebergementParser(TouristicContentApidaeParser):
        label = "Hébergements"
        api_key = 'xxxxxxxx'
        project_id = 9999
        selection_id = 99999
        category = "Hébergement"
        type1 = ["Camping"]
        type2 = ["3 étoiles", "Tourisme et Handicap"]  # just remove this line if no type2

Then set up appropriate values:

* ``label`` at your convenience,
* ``api_key``, ``project_id`` and ``selection_id`` according to your APIDAE (ex-SITRA) configuration
* ``category``, ``type1`` and ``type2`` (optional) to select in which Geotrek category/type imported objects should go
* You can add ``delete = True`` in your class if you want to delete objects in Geotrek databases that has been deleted in your Apidae selection. It will only delete objects that match with your class settings (category, types, portal...)
* You can also use the class ``HebergementParser`` if you only import accomodations
* See https://github.com/GeotrekCE/Geotrek-admin/blob/master/geotrek/tourism/parsers.py for details about Parsers

You can duplicate the class. Each class must have a different name.
Don't forget the u character before strings if they contain non-ascii characters.

To apply changes, you may have to run ``sudo service geotrek restart``.


Configure Marque Esprit Parc import
-----------------------------------

To import touristic content from Esprit Parc national database, create (or update) ``/opt/geotrek-admin/var/conf/parsers.py`` file with the following content:

::

    from geotrek.tourism.parsers import EspritParcParser

    class XXXEspritParcParser(EspritParcParser):
        label = "Marque Esprit Parc"
        url = "https://gestion.espritparcnational.com/ws/?f=getProduitsSelonParc&codeParc=XXX"

Then set up appropriate values:

* ``XXX`` by unique national park code (ex: PNE)

You can duplicate the class. Each class must have a different name.
Don't forget the u character before strings if they contain non-ascii characters.

In this case categories and types in Geotrek database have to be the same as in Esprit parc database. Otherwise missing categories and types will be created in Geotrek database.

Imported contents will be automatically published and approved. 

If you use an url that filters a unique category, you can change its name. Example to get only Honey products and set the Geotrek category and type in which import them:

::

    class MielEspritParcParser(EspritParcParser):
        label = "Miel Esprit Parc national"
        url = "https://gestion.espritparcnational.com/ws/?f=getProduitsSelonParc&codeParc=XXX&typologie=API"
        constant_fields = {
            'category': "GeotrekCategoryName",
            'published': True,
            'approved': True,
            'deleted': False,
        }
        m2m_constant_fields = {
            'type1': "GeotrekTypeName",
        }

URL to get Esprit parc types: `https://gestion.espritparcnational.com/ws/?f=getTypologieProduits`.


Sensitive areas import
----------------------

When sensitive areas module is enabled, Geotrek provides 3 parsers to import data:

* Import sensitive areas from http://biodiv-sports.fr (``geotrek.sensitivity.parsers.BiodivParser``). By default this
  parser imports all sensitive areas in configured spatial extent.
* Import species sensitive areas from a ziped shapefile. Imported field names are: ``espece`` (required), ``contact``
  and ``descriptio``.
  Species with corresponding names have to be created manually before import.
* Import regulatory sensitive areas from a ziped shapefile. Imported field names are: ``nom`` (required), ``contact``,
  ``descriptio``, ``periode`` (month numbers separated with comas), ``pratiques`` (separated with comas), and ``url``.
  Practices with corresponding names have to be created manually before import.

You can start imports from "Import" menu or from command line. You can override them in your ``var/conf/parsers.py``
file.


Multiples import
----------------

When you need to import data for the same object found in 2 different parsers, you can to force the aggregation of both values in many to many relationship case.
It can be interesting with portals for example.

Param for the aggregation : ``m2m_aggregate_fields``

Here is an example with 2 parsers :

::

    class Portal_1Parser(XXXParser):
        portal = "portal_1"

    class AggregateParser(XXXParser):
        portal = "portal_2"
        m2m_aggregate_fields = ["portal"]

Then, when you import the first parser ``Portal_1Parser``, you get multiple objects with ``portal_1`` as portal.
If any object of the ``Portal_1Parser`` is also in ``AggregateParser``, fields in ``m2m_aggregate_fields`` will have their values not be replaced but aggregated.
Then your object in both portals will have as portal: ``portal_1, portal_2``

* Here in this example whenever you import the first parser ``Portal_1Parser``, portals are replaced because ``m2m_aggregate_fields`` is not filled. Then, be careful to import parsers in the right order or add the param ``m2m_aggregate_fields`` on all parsers.

If you need to cancel the aggregation of portals, remove param ``m2m_aggregate_fields``.


Start import from command line
------------------------------

Just run:

::

    sudo geotrek import HebergementParser

Change ``HebergementParser`` to match one of the class names in ``var/conf/parsers.py`` file.
You can add ``-v2`` parameter to make the command more verbose (show progress).
Thank to ``cron`` utility you can configure automatic imports.


Start import from Geotrek-admin UI
----------------------------------

Open the top right menu and clic on ``imports``.


Import data from a remote Geotrek instance
==========================================

Importing from a Geotrek instance works the same way as from SIT.
A usecase for this is to aggregate data from several Geotrek-admin instance.

.. danger::
    Importing data from a remote Geotrek instance does not work with dynamic segmentation, your instance where you import data
    must have dynamic segmentation disabled.


For example, to import treks from another instance,
edit ``/opt/geotrek-admin/var/conf/parsers.py`` file with the following content:

::

    class DemoGeotrekTrekParser(BaseGeotrekTrekParser):
        url = "https://remote-geotrek-admin.net"  # replace url with remote instance url
        delete = False
        field_options = {
            'difficulty': {'create': True, },
            'route': {'create': True, },
            'themes': {'create': True},
            'practice': {'create': True},
            'accessibilities': {'create': True},
            'networks': {'create': True},
            'geom': {'required': True},
            'labels': {'create': True},
        }

Then run in command line

::

    sudo geotrek import DemoGeotrekTrekParser

Treks are now imported into your own instance.


Import data from a file
=======================

You can also use some of Geotrek commands to import data from a vector file handled by GDAL (https://gdal.org/drivers/vector/index.htm) (e.g.: ESRI Shapefile, GeoJSON, GeoPackage etc.)

Possible data are e.g.: POI, infrastructures, signages, cities, districts, restricted areas.

You must use these commands to import spatial data because of the dynamic segmentation, which will not be computed if you enter the data manually. 

Here are the Geotrek commands available to import data from file:

- ``loadinfrastructure``
- ``loadsignage``
- ``loadpoi``
- ``loadcities``
- ``loaddistricts``
- ``loadrestrictedareas``

Usually, these commands come with ability to match file attributes to model fields.
    
To get help about a command:

::

    sudo geotrek help <subcommand>

Delete attachment from disk
===========================

When an attachment (eg. pictures) is removed, its file is not automatically removed from disk.
You have to run ``sudo geotrek clean_attachments`` manually or in a cron to remove old files.
After that, you should run ``sudo geotrek thumbnail_cleanup`` to remove old thumbnails.
